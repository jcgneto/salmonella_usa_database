# Project title: Identification of novel genomic signatures of environmental adaptation in Salmonella enterica 

* Analysis of Salmonella genomes using publicly available genomes (SRA-NCBI) from the United States.

# Group members:

Natasha Pavlovikj - UNL (Computer Scientist);
Byron Chaves - UNL (Food Safety expert);

Andrew Benson - UNL (leader PI)

## Objectives  

* Population genomics analysis of S.Typhimurium isolated from United States (entire NCBI database)
-- isolates of S. Typhimurium will be filtered from this database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#/search/taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)

* Genome-wide association study to identify genomic events separating major ribotypes vs others 

### Computational approach

1. Download all paired-ended Illumina reads to the HCC cluster 
2. Quality check and trim reads (the scalability of this step will be tested as we move along)
3.
