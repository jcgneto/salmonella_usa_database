#Pipeline - Steps
## all scripts can be found inside the scripts directory

1. Download all targeted Salmonella Typhimurium genomes from SRA using ncbi-pathogen list (scripts == get_sra_reads.sh)
### Important - we are only using genomes sequenced using Illumina MiSeq with paired-ended sequences

2. Trim raw reads using Trimmomatic (scripts == trim.sh)

3. Quality control trimmed files using FASTQC (scripts == fastqc.sh) - this is not a conditional in the pipeline but just an 
#assurance that the adpaters were trimmed 

4. Genome assembly using Spades using trimmed paired files (scripts == spades.sh)

5. Genome annotation using contigs.fasta (output from spades) using Prokka (scripts == prokka.sh)
### keep only .gff files for each genome

6. Use roary to get pangenome analysis using .gff files originated with Prokka (scripts == roary.sh) 
### keep all files generated with roary  

7. Yet to come - scripts for Scoary, phylogeny in python, random forest and logistic PCA, and ST & ribotype calling

Notes:

*Raw reads will be allocated in our Attic storage directory
*Scripts will be parallelized and run with pegasus
*Keep only the describe files and purge all the remainder products of each step
